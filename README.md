# Raycasting with cub3d

Cub3d is a graphical project part of 42 school at Paris. \
The goal is to reproduce a small version of the wolfenstein game.

To make this project I followed a tutorial from https://lodev.org/.

This is not just raycasting but its a lot of parsing (file config to memory with error management).
